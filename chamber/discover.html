                <h2>About Waikato</h2>
                <p>
                    The Waikato region is located in the upper North Island of New Zealand.
                    It encompasses a diverse range of landscapes, stretching from the Coromandel Peninsula in the north
                    to the north-eastern slopes of Mount Ruapehu in the south.
                    The region spans from the west coast, through the Waikato and Hauraki areas, to the Coromandel
                    Peninsula on the east coast.
                    It is bordered by Auckland to the north, Bay of Plenty to the east, Hawke's Bay to the southeast,
                    and Manawatū-Whanganui and Taranaki to the south.
                    The Waikato River catchment broadly defines its extent, with other major river catchments including
                    those of Waihou, Piako, Awakino, and Mokau rivers.
                    The Waikato region is governed by the Waikato Regional Council and includes all or part of eleven
                    territorial authorities—the most of any region in New Zealand.
                    These are Taupō District (part), Waikato District, Waitomo District (part), Thames-Coromandel
                    District, Ōtorohanga District, South Waikato District, Matamata-Piako District, Waipa District,
                    Hauraki District, Rotorua Lakes District (part), and Hamilton City.
                    As of June 2023, the population of the Waikato region is estimated to be around 522,600 people. The
                    population density is about 22 people per km².
                    The demographic composition includes a mix of ethnicities with 71.7% identifying as European
                    (Pākehā), 25.2% as Māori, and smaller percentages for Pasifika and Asian communities.

                <h2>Economy</h2>
                <p>
                    The Waikato region, located in the North Island of New Zealand, is recognized as one of the most
                    productive areas in the country.
                    Its economy is diverse and serves as a springboard for innovation and industry. The region's
                    economic landscape is characterized by a blend of primary industries, manufacturing, services, and
                    emerging sectors such as aquaculture.
                    The economy of Waikato is heavily reliant on agriculture, particularly dairy farming which has been
                    a cornerstone since the late 19th century.
                    In recent years, dairy processing has become a major industry within the region.
                    The subnational GDP was estimated at NZ$25.84 billion in March 2019, contributing about 8.5% to New
                    Zealand's national GDP.
                </p>

                <h2>Climate</h2>
                <p>
                    The Waikato region in New Zealand exhibits a diverse range of climates due to its varied landscapes.
                    The climate is influenced by geographical features such as coastal areas, plains, and high-altitude
                    regions.
                    This diversity results in distinct climatic characteristics across different parts of the region.
                    Waikato experiences a mild temperate climate with moderate rainfall ranging from 1200-1600 mm
                    annually.
                    Summers are typically drier with temperatures reaching between 22-28 degrees Celsius while winters
                    see maximum temperatures between 10-16 degrees Celsius.
                </p>

                <h2>Culture</h2>
                <p>
                    The name “Waikato” is derived from the Māori language meaning “flowing water,” specifically
                    combining “wai” for water and “kato” for the pull of a river current in the sea.
                    In spoken language, some people refer to it as “the Waikato,” while others do not use “the.”
                    This variation often reflects different definitions or perceptions of regional boundaries.
                    The cultural landscape of Waikato is rich due to its Māori heritage and European influences.
                    The region hosts various events that celebrate this diversity and has a vibrant arts community.

                    The University of Waikato opened in 1964 after many years of energetic lobbying by a group of
                    Hamilton locals, determined to have a university in their city.
                    To begin with, facilities were sparse, but in early 1965 new buildings were officially opened by
                    then Governor-General Sir Bernard Fergusson.
                    Sir Don Llewellyn was the founding Vice-Chancellor.
                    By the 1980s, Waikato was the fastest-growing university in New Zealand. Computer Science became an
                    increasingly popular study choice and the thriving Department was elevated to a School of Computing
                    and Mathematical Sciences in 1987.
                    The University always had a close relationship with its neighbouring teachers'college and, leading
                    the way for others to follow, became the first university in New Zealand to combine with its
                    regional teachers' college.
                    Through its teaching programmes, the University began to establish a presence in Tauranga.

                    The University of Waikato has a longstanding relationship with the Kīngitanga and Waikato-Tainui,
                    who are the traditional owners and custodians in the Waikato region.
                    The University's Hamilton campus is based on land originally inhabited by Ngāti Wairere and Ngāti
                    Hauā of Tainui.
                    Much of this land was confiscated in 1864 by the colonial government following the Waikato Land
                    Wars, an act later found to be in breach of the Treaty of Waitangi.
                    To redress this, the Crown signed a settlement with Waikato-Tainui in 1995, part of which vested the
                    land on which the Hamilton campus stands in the title of the first Māori King, Pōtatau Te
                    Wherowhero, to ensure it could not be alienated.
                    It is now leased to the University by Waikato-Tainui.
                    In 1991 Te Rōpū Manukura was formed as a consultative body to the University Council.
                    It now sits in partnership with the University Council as the Kaitiaki (guardian) of the Treaty of
                    Waitangi for the University.
                    Te Rōpū Manukura is currently made up of members from over 20 different iwi within the catchment
                    area of the University.
                    In 2009, Kīngitanga Day was established as a way to honour and strengthen the connection between the
                    University, Kīngitanga, Waikato-Tainui, and many other iwi across the country.
                    Kīngitanga Day is a community-focused event and is celebrated annually in September.
